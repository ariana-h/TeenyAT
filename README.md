## 1. Overview

The TeenyAT ( /ˈtē·nē·'at/ ) is a 16-bit virtual embedded micro-controller delivered as a C library so systems can be simulated around it with ease.  System designers create an instance (or more) of the TeenyAT, providing a binary image to load and execute and registering callbacks for any attempted reads or writes to the bus by the running program.

## 2. Core Architectural Elements
The TeenyAT core architecture is made up of 16 bit words. Each memory address points to a 16 bit value. If measuring storage in terms of words, there is 32K words of RAM. The hexadecimal addresses range from 0x0000 to 0x7FFF and addresses 0x8000 through 0xFFFF are available for hardware access.
	 
There are 8 registers available for all register-use instructions: PC or reg[1] is the program counter. It contains the address of the next instruction. The PC is initialized to address 0x0000. The next register is the SP or reg[2] is the stack pointer. The SP contains the address of the next top element in the stack and is initialized to address 0x7FFF. This initial address means the SP is empty. It grows down in memory. The "zero" register or rZ is reg[0]. This register always contains the value 0. All attempts to modify the "zero" register are ignored. The rest of the available registers: rA through rE, reg[3] through reg[7], are general purpose registers.  

Each instruction is encoded in either one or two 16 bit words. The fetch instruction must set *PC = PC + 2 - T*, where *T* is the "teeny" bit to account for this. If the teeny bit is equal to one, "teeny == 1," then the instruction is 16 bits. This essentially assumes that the second word is 0x0000. If the teeny bit is equal to zero, "teeny == 0," then the instruction is 32 bits and requires an additional cycle. We can also say that the second instruction is not teeny. Any fetches to RAM referencing addresses greater than 0x7FFF will result in the PC being reset to 0x0000.

A four bit immediate field can be used as flags. In order of highest to lowest order bits, the flags are: carry, equal to, less than, and greater than. The highest bit is currently reserved as the carry bit in some places but it is not fully supported at this moment. The equal flag is set when the last comparison, by virtue of a previous instruction, is found to the equal. The less than flag is set the last comparison resulted in the first register being less than the second register. Likewise, the greater than flag is set when the result of the last comparison resulted in the first register being greater than the second register.

### In a condensed format, the architecture contains:
-   16 bit words (each memory address points to a 16 bit value)
-   32K words of RAM from 0x0000 through 0x7FFF
     -   Address 0x8000-0xFFFF: available for hardware access
-   8 registers available to all register-use instructions
	-   PC (reg[1]) is the program counter, contains address of next instruction, initially 0x0000    
	-   SP (reg[2]) is the stack pointer, contains address of the next top element, initially 0x7FFF (empty)
		-   stack grows down in memory
	-   rZ (reg[0]) is the "Zero" register, which always contains the value 0.
		-   all attempts to modify rZ are ignored
	-   rA through rE (reg[3] through reg[7]) are general purpose registers
-   Instructions encoded in either one or two 16 bit words
	-   Fetch must set PC = PC + 2 - T, where T is the "teeny" bit to account for this
		-   if teeny == 1, the instruction is 16 bits (essentially assumes 2nd word is 0x0000)
		-   if teeny == 0, the instruction is 32 bits and  requires an additional cycle
     -   Fetches to RAM greater than 0x7FFF will result in the PC being set to 0
-   Using 4 bit immedate field as flags
    -   Flags in order from highest to lowest order bits
        -   Reserved currently implemented as carry in some places but not fully supported at the moment
        -   Equals set when last compare is found to be Equal
        -   Less set when the last compare resulted in reg1 being less than reg2
        -   Greater set when the last compare resulted in reg1 being greater than reg2

***Fun fact:** If all words of memory are initialized to 0x0480, then if-ever a program should try to run code beyond that loaded into memory, the fetched instruction will be 0x0480, which decodes into "set PC, rZ + 0x0"... so the program will start over automatically since the first line of code is at 0x0000.​*

## 6. Syntax
-   A line can start with any of the following identifiers:
    -   .const for a constant line
        -   .const  Identifier  Value
        -   .const EXAMPLE 0xBEEF
    -   .var for a variable line
        -   .var Identifier Value
        -   .var example 0xBEEF
    -   ! for a label
        -   In this case the label includes the starting symbol
        -   !example
### 6.1 Instructions
-   An instruction can consist of any of the identifiers defined above. All instructions should follow their defined syntax.
-   Immediate values insert all of the immediate values found on the line of code they appear on into memory.
    -   JMP !test
        -   This will insert immedate values in memory following the jump to test instruction. In this case, it would be 0xBeef 0xFeed 10 'r' 0b1111_0000_0000_0_1_0_0.
    -   !test  
            0xBeef 0xFeed 10  'r' 0b1111_0000_0000_0_1_0_0
        -   Here the test label points to the address of 0xBeef and can be used as the starting address of an array of these values.
### 6.2 Comments
-   Use a semicolon ';' to start a comment.
-   This will make everything past the ';' a comment on that line.
### 6.3 Labels
-   Use an exclamation point '!' for a label
    -   In this case, the label includes the starting symbol.
    -   !example
### 6.4 Constants
-   Use the .const or the .constant identifier for a constant line
    -   .const  Identifier  Value
    -   .const EXAMPLE 0xBEEF
### 6.5 Variables
-   Use the .var or the .variable identifier for a variable line.
    -   .var Identifier Value
    -   .var example 0xBEEF
